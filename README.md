## Overview

<p align="justify">
Machine Learning includes the design and the study of algorithms that can learn from experience, improve their performance and make predictions. In this introductory (2 credit hour, 8 week) course students will explore the main concepts behind several different machine learning algorithms and gain practical experience implementing them using Python and several of the most frequently used packages; pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, etc. Students will also learn how to construct and interpret their own machine learning models in Python.
